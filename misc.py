#Transformation of loads applied to the center of gravity of the deployed solar panel to reaction forces, with no ratation:
 
#Forces in Z direction (considering the total Fz force to be positive upwards):
#Applied moment:
## Mx = l_cg*Fz
#Reaction force in the y direction in each lug to counter the moment:
## Ry * b = Mx
#Reaction force in the z direction in each lug to counter the applied force:
## Rz = Fz / 2

#Forces in the x direction (considering the total Fx force to be positive towards the "paper"):
#Applied moment:
## Mx = l_cg*Fx
#Reaction moment in each lug to counter the moment:
## The lug will need to handle the moment by itself by creating a moment itselft tocounter the applied moment
#Reaction force in the x direction en each lug to counter the applied force:
## Rx = Fx / 2

#Forces in the y direction (considering the total Fy force to be positive pointing away from the S/C):
#Applied moment:
##There is no applied moment
#Reaction force in the y direction en each lug to counter the applied force:
##Ry = Fy / 2
